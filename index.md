Welcome to my homepage on GitHub.

### About

I am 56 years old and I am living in Nyon (Switzerland). After 31 enthousiastic years working at a major luxury company, the adventure came to an end with COVID19. 
Far from being the end of the world, I am taking advantage of this situation to renew with my software development passion and add new practical skills.

**wsaero** is my personal project. The name stands for _Aeronautical Web Service_ and the service aims at displaying the weather bulletins (METAR and TAF) at various airfields.

Now, if you find my profile intriguing, then please have a look on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/robin-alexander-ch)

### wsaero

The inner goal of wsaero is to give me additional hands-on experience with software technology, such as:
- Programming languages:
  - php
  - javascript
- markup-related technology:
  - xml, rss, kml
  - xsl
  - xslt (for output mashup and transformation)
- web API services (REST)
- Mapping solutions (OpenStreetMap, Leaflet.js)
- DEVOPS techniques:
  - git & GitHub
  - docker
  - cloud computing 

Click [here](https://wsaero-x3rsbe6nxq-uc.a.run.app) to see the latest version of **wsaero** in action. Please, note that:
1. The display will vary, depending on the device you are using small (ie. a smartphone) or large (ie. a tablet or a computer)
2. The service is running on a small free-of-charge docker environment offered by Google
