Welcome to my homepage on GitHub.

### About

I am 56 years old and I am living in Nyon (Switzerland). After 31 enthousiastic years working at a major luxury company, the adventure came to an end with COVID19. 
Far from being the end of the world, I am taking advantage of this situation to renew with my software development passion and refresh my skills.

**wsaero** is my personal project. The name stands for _Aeronautical Web Service_ and the service aims at displaying the weather bulletins (METAR and TAF) at various airfields.

Now, if you find my profile intriguing, then please have a look on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/robin-alexander-ch)
