### About

I am 56 years old and I am living in Nyon (Switzerland). After [31 enthousiastic years](https://linkedin.com/in/robin-alexander-ch) working at a major luxury company, the adventure came to an end with COVID19. 
Far from being the end of the world, I am taking advantage of this situation to fulfill my passion for software development and add new practical skills.

### My personal project - wsaero

wsaero stands for _Aeronautical Web Service_ and the service aims at retrieving and returning/displaying weather bulletins (METAR and TAF) at requested airfields.

The inner goal of wsaero is to give me additional hands-on experience with software technology, such as:
- *Web Programming* languages:
  - php
  - javascript
- *markup* documents :
  - html5, css, md
  - xml, rss, kml, xsl
  - xslt (for output mashup and transformation)
- *REST* web services
- *Mapping* solutions (OpenStreetMap, Leaflet.js)
- *DEVOPS* :
  - git & GitHub
  - docker
  - cloud computing 

Click [here](https://wsaero-x3rsbe6nxq-uc.a.run.app) to see the latest version of **wsaero** in action. Please, note that:
1. The display will vary, depending on the size of the device you are using: text for small ones and maps for larger ones
2. The service is running on a small free-of-charge docker environment offered by Google
